# Bayes

## Purpose

This repository contains R projects developed by [Adam Dimech](https://www.adonline.id.au) for the purposes of training. There are currently two components:
- *bayes*: Training associated with Richard McElreath's course [_Statistical Rethinking_](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) including the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN) and [book](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919). I am not completing this course at the same pace that McElreath is delivering it.
- *r4ds*: Practice examples from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

This repository is mostly maintained using Git within RStudio using the methodology published on my [Coding Blog](https://code.adonline.id.au/connect-an-rstudio-project-to-github/)
